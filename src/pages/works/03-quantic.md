- Improved the Motion Capture Pipeline of a AAA studio, regularly working with a variety of teams: tool programmers, animators, mocap operators, producers, directors, writers, environment and character artists, among others.
- Developed a standalone Qt/Python application designed to process thousands of animations automatically: ROM calibration, retargeting within the environment in Motion Builder, exporting in Maya then in-engine - all in a single slick.
- Developed a Motion Builder plugin with Qt/PySide to manage a 3D scene live during a shoot while handling production tracking to take care of last minute changes and unforeseen issues.
- Setting up of [Flow's](https://www.autodesk.com/ch-fr/products/flow-production-tracking/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) entity architecture and processes for efficient production tracking at scale among 300+ coworkers.
- Creation of a fullstack website to handle Flow's event system in realtime through Webhooks using Django and Postgres for the backend and Vue for the frontend.
- Developed an RV plugin to let animators define timestamps in mocap reference videos for later automatic processes - this step used that used to take hours now only take a few minutes.
- Developed a C++ library that converted the company's custom 3D file format to FBXon the fly so that characters and environments could be imported in other tools like Motion Builder.
- Developed a collection of tools to handle the positioning of mocaped characters in the engine's levels so character would be placed correclty and automatically in the game's world without human intervention.
