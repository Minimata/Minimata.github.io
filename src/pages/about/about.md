I'm first and foremost a software engineer. Being able to understand, sythesize and translate the needs of the project at hand into software architecture and features is the heart of my work.

In an effort to improve game development environments, my latest efforts have been to learn and implement Development Operations (DevOps) for game engines. I've implemented automated testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment on the cloud for Godot, Unreal Engine and Unity. Along with a few other tools, this can constitute a whole game development pipeline for small and medium teams that lets them develop in the best of conditions. I've called this cloud platform Game Dev Space ([link](https://game-dev.space/)), built with open source software and deployed with docker.

Other than that, most of my programming experience lies in tools programming. During my five years in AAA at Quantic Dream as a Motion Capture Pipeline Developer, I've used Python and Qt/PySide to build scripts, librairies, standalone applications, Motion Builder plugins, server applications and web backends. Web development is a big part of tools programming since it provides easily accessible, maintainable and interoperable applications. I've developed both static and dynamic websites for data visualization and process management using a variety of tools like Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Tailwind, Vite, Django, Vitest, Storybook and Playwright.

As a game developer, I have essentially done all of my projects in game jams or by expanding on game jam projects. I have developed most of my games on Unreal Engine 4/5 using Blueprints and heavily relying on the Material Editor and the Procedural Content Generation framework. Recently, I've discovered Godot, an open source, lightweight and elegant game engine which makes for a wonderful Developer Experience especially when paired with Game Dev Space for testing and automation.
