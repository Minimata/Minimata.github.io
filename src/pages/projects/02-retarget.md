At [Quantic Dream](https://www.quanticdream.com/fr), a single day of Motion Capture (Mocap) can mean hundreds of animations, and we're shooting again the day after. That's why I built a Qt tool to automate, using Motion Builder and Maya, the processing and retargeting of these animations with a single click.

This tool let the Animation Lead deliver a rough batch of animations barely a few hours after a shooting was done so they could be integrated in game. This gave her team some time to cleanly retarget the animations and rerun some parts of the automated process to replace the rough animations with the now clean ones.

Learn more about this tool in [this presentation](https://youtu.be/fcEYqQzGeoI?t=1652) we made in 2022 at Gamecamp (in french).
