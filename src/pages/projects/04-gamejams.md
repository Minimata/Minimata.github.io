My first Game Jam was in 2016 using Unity and it was the [Epic Game Jam](https://epicgamejam.com/). Since then I've participated to tens of them: other Epics, Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare, all 48 hours or less. Sometimes alone, sometimes in teams of up to fifteen people.

My latest game with Unity is [Doubly Fluffy](https://minimata.itch.io/doublyfluffy), a rythm-racing game made with a team of three people during the Epic Game Jam 2017.

I tried to do the 2022 Epic Game Jam by myself to learn the new Procedural Content Generation system of Unreal Engine 5. This is how I've built [Reborn](https://minimata.itch.io/reborn), an interactive experience where you have to climb a mountain and the time of day evolves with your altitude. No single mesh in this level has been hand-placed, it's all procedural.

My latest Game Jam has been on Godot 4 and it was once again an Epic Game Jam. We were a team of seven and created [Wildwood Melodies](https://minimata.itch.io/egj24), a 2D game where you have to imitate the song of animals to gain their powers and find your way back home. This is the first time I used [Game Dev Space](https://game-dev.space/) for a gamejam and it held really well, allowing us to make last minute changes after playtests and deploying the game on Itch in barely a minute, automatically.
